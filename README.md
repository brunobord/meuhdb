# MeuhDb

> The database that says "Meuh"

**MeuhDb** is a "dummy" key / JSON value store written in Python.

## Basic usage

``` python
>>> from meuhdb.core import MeuhDb
>>> db = MeuhDb()  # Create in-memory database
>>> db.set('one', {'name': 'Alice', 'good': True, 'chief': True})
>>> db.set('two', {'name': 'Bob', 'good': True})
>>> db.set('three', {'name': 'Carl', 'good': False})
>>> db.filter(name='Alice')
{'one': {'chief': True, 'good': True, 'name': 'Alice'}}
>>> db.filter(good=True)
{'two': {'good': True, 'name': 'Bob'}, 'one': {'chief': True, 'good': True, 'name': 'Alice'}}
>>> db.filter(good=True, chief=True)  # More than one criteria, it's a "AND"
{'one': {'chief': True, 'good': True, 'name': 'Alice'}
>>> db.delete('one')
>>> db.filter(name='Alice')
{}
>>> db.exists('one')
False
```

At the moment, you can only query on "equalities", i.e. a strict equality
between what you're looking for and what's in the JSON fields (no special
operator: greater than, different, etc).

The values must be JSON serializable values (dictionaries, does not work with
dates, datetimes, sets, etc.)


### Database creation

There are a few optional parameters with the ``MeuhDb`` class constructor:

```python
MeuhDb(path=None, autocommit=False, backend=DEFAULT_BACKEND)
```

* `path`: is the file path of your JSON database if you want to save it to a
  file. If the file already exists, **MeuhDb** tries to load its data. If it's
  not provided, the DB will be in-memory.
* `autocommit`: if set to `True`, every "write" operation will be transmitted
  to the file. It can be I/O consuming, since the whole DB is written on the
  disk every time.
* `backend`: chose which JSON backend you can use. There are 4 backends
  possible, from the least efficient, to the best one: "json" (from the standard
  lib), "simplejson", "ujson" and "msgpack".
  **MeuhDb** will try to load each one of them and make them available if you
  want. The ``DEFAULT_BACKEND`` value will take the most performing backend
  value available.
  If you provide an unavailable backend, don't worry, **MeuhDb** will fallback
  to the comfortable ``json` from the standard library.

**WARNING**: ``msgpack`` library will load and dump your JSON data into a binary
format. It's a very fast and compact storage method, but binary data is not
readable with a regular text viewer. If you want to browse your database, you'll
have to rely in the ``msgpack`` library.

Example:

```python
>>> db = MeuhDb('hello.json', autocommit=False, backend='ujson')
>>> db.set('1', {'name': 'Alice'})  # data is not on disk
>>> db.commit()  # saves to disk
>>> db = MeuhDb('hello.json', autocommit=True)
>>> db.all()  # Data is reloaded from the disk
>>> {u'1': {u'name': u'Alice'}}
>>> db.set('2', {'name': 'Bob'})  # data is written on disk
```

## Indexes

**MeuhDb** supports index creation. You can index one or more fields to accelerate
queries.

Example:

```python
>>> db.create_index('name')
>>> db.filter(name='Alice')  # Will use this index
```

* You don't have to index all the fields available in your JSON values, only
  the one you may query on.
* Indexes will be saved on ``commit()`` along with the Database.
* if somehow the index is screwed up, simply create it with the ``recreate``
  argument: ``db.create_index('name', recreate=True)``.

## Warnings

This is not a real actual ACID-ready database manager. This will probably suit a
"one-user-only" use case. Opening an loading a large file is very I/O consuming.
So **MeuhDb** will **never** replace a proper NoSQL database system.

## Hack

**MeuhDb** will work with a standard Python 2 distribution. (I've got plans
to make it Python-3-ready)

Inside a virtualenv, simply clone this repository and install it in dev mode:

```
git clone https://github.com/brunobord/meuhdb.git
cd meuhdb
pip install -e ./
```

You may want to install one or more of these packages to be able to pick one of
these enhanced backends:

* `simplejson`
* `usjon`
* `msgpack`

To run the tests, you'll have to install ``tox`` (``pip install tox``) and
simply run the command ``tox``.

### Todo

A lot of things:

* Advanced Index manipulation (remove_index, uniqueness?, multiple fields?),
* Advanced queries (Ã  la Django with ``field__gt``, ``field__contains``, etc),
* ``insert`` method with automatic UUID generation,
* Python 3 support...
